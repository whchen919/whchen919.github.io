The shipboard operation of rotorcraft poses significant challenges to the pilots onboard or the flight  controls of unoccupied aerial systems (UAS). Aerodynamic interactions between the ship’s airwake and the wake of the rotor(s) result in a highly unsteady turbulent flow field that impacts the rotorcraft aerodynamic and flight dynamic behavior. This project goes through model-scale experiments with main goal being to provide a holistic understanding of the airwake–rotor interaction through data collected using particle image velocimetry (PIV), surface pressure, and six-component rotor hub loads measurements. Physical insights and measured data are also used to verify and validate the numerical simulation models developed within the lab.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
