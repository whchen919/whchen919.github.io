  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

  abstract={A rotary balance technique is developed at the Aerospace Science and Technology Research Center (ASTRC) of National Chung Kung University. The aerodynamic characteristics of a standard dynamics model (SDM) with a generic fighter-aircraft shape in a spinning motion are determined for an angle of attack of 0°~30° and a reduced frequency of -0.1~0.1. For a specific angle of attack, a change in the reduced frequency has a minor effect on the coefficients for normal force and pitching moment. The difference between the data and the results from other wind tunnel tests (NASA Ames and FD- 09) increases as the angle of attack increases, so the Reynolds number and the compressibility for coefficients of normal force and pitching have an effect. For side force and rolling/yawing moments, the results agree reasonably well, as do the derivatives with respect to the rotational speed.},

  abstract={Bird flight involves complicated wing kinematics, especially during hovering flight. The detailed aerodynamic effects of wings with higher degrees of freedom (DOFs) remain to be further investigated. Therefore, we designed a novel multiarticulate flapping-wing robot with five DOFs on each wing. Using this robot we aimed to investigate the more complicated wing kinematics of birds, which are usually difficult to test and analyze. In this study the robot was programmed to mimic the previously observed hovering motion of passerines, and force measurements and particle image velocimetry experiments. We experimented with two different wing-folding amplitudes: one with a larger folding amplitude, similar to that of real passerines, and one with only half the amplitude. The robot kinematics were verified utilizing direct linear transformation, which confirmed that the wing trajectories had an acceptable correlation with the desired motion. According to the lift force measurements, four phases of the wingbeat cycle were characterized and elaborated through camera images and flow visualization. We found that the reduction in folding amplitude caused a higher negative force during upstrokes and also induced a greater positive force at the initial downstroke through ‘wake capture’. This could increase the vertical oscillation while hovering despite a minor increase in average force production. This phenomenon was not observed during forward flight in previous studies. Our results provide a critical understanding of the effect of wing folding which is required for designing the wing kinematics of future advanced flapping-wing micro aerial vehicles.},
