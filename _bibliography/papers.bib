  abstract={Rotorcraft shipboard operations are risky and demand high piloting skills. To gain further understanding and familiarize pilots with these complicated scenarios, various methods of computational simulations have been used in the past decades. Yet, some simulation methods may not capture a realistic response of the rotorcraft due to simplified modeling of the interactional aerodynamics in order to achieve real-time capability for pilot training. Thus, improvements to these simulations are required, and experimental data that unveil the interactional aerodynamics and dynamics between the rotor and ship are needed for computational validation efforts. In this study, an extensive experimental investigation of the ship‐rotor dynamic interface problem was conducted to gain a general understanding of the interactional aerodynamics between a 1:100 wind-tunnel-scale NATO Generic Destroyer and a representative single main rotor, operating both stationary and dynamically moving in space in the vicinity of the landing deck. Data obtained through simultaneous measurements of rotor hub loads, ship deck surface pressures, and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry flow fields gave valuable insight into the highly coupled aerodynamic phenomena. Results showed that the rotor hub loads exhibited a high dependency on both the wind direction and also the position of the rotor relative to the landing deck. A bifurcation in the regions of high unsteady thrust was observed under certain wind conditions due to the ship airwake, impacting different portions of the rotor disk. The inflow angles across the rotor disk were estimated and assessed through flow field measurement, revealing how the ship airwake altered the rotor inflow and wake structure that contributed to the unique change in rotor loads under various hovering conditions.},

  abstract={A rotary balance technique is developed at the Aerospace Science and Technology Research Center (ASTRC) of National Chung Kung University. The aerodynamic characteristics of a standard dynamics model (SDM) with a generic fighter-aircraft shape in a spinning motion are determined for an angle of attack of 0°~30° and a reduced frequency of -0.1~0.1. For a specific angle of attack, a change in the reduced frequency has a minor effect on the coefficients for normal force and pitching moment. The difference between the data and the results from other wind tunnel tests (NASA Ames and FD- 09) increases as the angle of attack increases, so the Reynolds number and the compressibility for coefficients of normal force and pitching have an effect. For side force and rolling/yawing moments, the results agree reasonably well, as do the derivatives with respect to the rotational speed.},

  abstract={Bird flight involves complicated wing kinematics, especially during hovering flight. The detailed aerodynamic effects of wings with higher degrees of freedom (DOFs) remain to be further investigated. Therefore, we designed a novel multiarticulate flapping-wing robot with five DOFs on each wing. Using this robot we aimed to investigate the more complicated wing kinematics of birds, which are usually difficult to test and analyze. In this study the robot was programmed to mimic the previously observed hovering motion of passerines, and force measurements and particle image velocimetry experiments. We experimented with two different wing-folding amplitudes: one with a larger folding amplitude, similar to that of real passerines, and one with only half the amplitude. The robot kinematics were verified utilizing direct linear transformation, which confirmed that the wing trajectories had an acceptable correlation with the desired motion. According to the lift force measurements, four phases of the wingbeat cycle were characterized and elaborated through camera images and flow visualization. We found that the reduction in folding amplitude caused a higher negative force during upstrokes and also induced a greater positive force at the initial downstroke through ‘wake capture’. This could increase the vertical oscillation while hovering despite a minor increase in average force production. This phenomenon was not observed during forward flight in previous studies. Our results provide a critical understanding of the effect of wing folding which is required for designing the wing kinematics of future advanced flapping-wing micro aerial vehicles.},

  abstract={In this study, a novel multiarticulate flapping-wing robot with five degrees of freedom on each wing was designed and fabricated to replicate hovering motion of passerines for force measurement and PIV experiments. Recent years, several researchers have focused on exploring the aerodynamic characteristics of insects and also some simplified model of birds. However, birds, like passerines, perform much more complicated wing kinematics which are rarely tested. The detailed aerodynamic effect of wings with higher degrees of freedom still remains to be further investigated. Two modified wing trajectories from previous observed wing kinematics of passerines were experimented in this research to investigate the aerodynamic differences, one with a larger folding amplitude, similar to that of real passerines, and one with only half the amplitude. Kinematics of the robot was verified utilizing direct linear transformation (DLT) which confirmed that the wing trajectories had high correlation with the desired motion. According to the lift force measurements, 4 phases of the wingbeat cycle were characterized and elaborated through camera images and flow visualization result. We found that although less folding caused higher negative lift during upstrokes it also induced greater lift at the initial downstroke through ‘wake capture’ which ended up producing higher cycle-averaged lift. However, this does not imply that less folding benefits flight performance.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
